## Overview

The proposed method introduces a lightweight and interpretable CNN framework that leverages Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) based time-frequency scalograms of AE signals to detect faults in centrifugal pumps. It includes:

- AE signal preprocessing and burst-aware segmentation.
- Scalogram generation using CWT.
- Lightweight CNN model for fault classification.
- Grad-CAM++ for interpretability.
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
